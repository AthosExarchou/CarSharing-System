# CarSharing System – Software Engineering Assignment

This repository contains the design and analysis of a **CarSharing platform**, created as part of the course *"Ανάλυση Συστημάτων και Τεχνολογία Λογισμικού"* (Systems Analysis and Software Technology) in June 2024 at [Harokopio University of Athens – Dept. of Informatics and Telematics](https://www.dit.hua.gr).

The system provides functionality for **vehicle owners** to rent out their cars and for **users** to rent available vehicles securely and efficiently. It includes features such as vehicle registration, reservations, cancellations, live tracking, ratings, and administrative controls.

## System Overview

The CarSharing platform supports the following key use cases:
- **Vehicle Registration** – Owners can add cars to the platform by submitting details and documents.
- **Vehicle Search & Rental** – Users can search, filter, and rent cars.
- **Reservation Management** – Users can cancel reservations; owners declare availability.
- **Tracking & Delivery** – Owners can track vehicles in real-time and confirm handovers.
- **Rating System** – Users rate vehicles; owners rate users with photos as proof.
- **Administration** – Admins manage users, vehicles, and rental statistics.

Non-functional requirements include GDPR compliance, scalability, cross-platform support, fast response times, and robust security.
